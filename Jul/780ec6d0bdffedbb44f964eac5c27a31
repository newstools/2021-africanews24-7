By: Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has noted an orchestrated campaign in which the Mail & Guardian, for whatever reasons is leading a campaign to defame her. The Ministry said it is aware that such campaign is sponsored and is informed by the factional interests of those who are hard at work in triumphalism to celebrate political points. Sisulu’s spokesperson Steve Motale said: “The Minister finds this very unfortunate that in a season of such challenge that we live through in which ordinary people as always pay with their lives some can be caught up in elections politics. “The Mail & Guardian has for the past four consecutive weeks published negative stories about the Minister aimed at tarnishing her image and portraying her as corrupt and incompetent. This unprofessional journalism borne from political bias does not serve the interest of what this country needs at the present moment”. Motale added: “The Minister therefore finds this act on the part of the Mail & Guardian as deplorable since she is occupied doing her work and fulfilling her ascribed role as expected. Today, the same publication revealed its true intentions of defaming the Minister by launching a vitriolic attack on her and others. The piece is defamatory and littered with unsubstantiated claims. “The Mail & Guardian has blatantly failed in its journalistic mandate to inform the public objectively, truthfully and without fear or favour. Instead, the publication has chosen to be part of a sponsored campaign to destroy political careers of some people including Minister Sisulu. This conduct is not only deplorable but erodes public trust in the media which has an important role to play in enhancing our hard-earned democracy”, said Motale.
