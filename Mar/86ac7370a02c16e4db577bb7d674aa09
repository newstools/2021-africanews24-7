By: Staff Reporter Johannesburg – eNCA has on Thursday announced the passing on of the anchor of ‘The Fix’, Karima Brown from Covid-19. Brown had been a regular face and contributor on eNCA for nearly five years, having been the host of ‘The Fix’ since May 2018 and a political commentator on the channel, since 2017. eNCA MD Norman Munzhelele expressed his condolences to her family during this difficult time. “For a long time, Karima has been a robust voice in South Africa’s media landscape. Her years of activism preceded this. She had a big personality and didn’t shy away from voicing her opinions. Karima believed in hope. She was also a loving mother, a loyal friend and a committed colleague. Her death leaves a massive void for many. Our thoughts are with her son, family and friends at this sad time.”
