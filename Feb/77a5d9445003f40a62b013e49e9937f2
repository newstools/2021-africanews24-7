By: Staff Reporter The Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu is demanding answers from the Lepelle Northern Water (LNW), one of the water utilities of the Department of Water and Sanitation for the emergency water project that has not yielded the intended outcomes in Moutse living community members without access to clean water. This after disturbing media reports indicating that the project which was meant to assist drought stricken Moutse community has not been successful. “What we have read is totally not acceptable, if it is true. We cannot allow people of Moutse to suffer like this whilst we have made resources available to them. I together with Premier Mathabatha made a commitment when we met with traditional leaders and community members that we were going to respond to their urgent needs. As a result, we made financial resources available for the people of Moutse”, said Minister Sisulu. Minister emphasized her displeasure that water tankers that were allocated to the Municipality had not been used because of the outstanding licensing and registration months after they had been delivered. Sisulu has written to the LNW to give her a detailed report on Moutse water project and the latter is expected to spell out the number of water tanks and water storage tanks that have been delivered, installed and in use and how much has been spent to date. “We cannot play games with the lives of the people, water is a basic human rights”, added Sisulu.
