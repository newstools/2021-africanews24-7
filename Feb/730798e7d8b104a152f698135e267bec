By: Sello Theletsane The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has on Wednesday, successfully instituted civil litigation in the Special Tribunal to interdict and restrain a former Lepelle Northern Water Chief Executive Officer from disposing of four immoveable properties, pending the final determination of pending action proceedings. In a judgment handed down on Friday, 05 February 2021, Judge Modiba also ordered the Registrar of Deeds in Pretoria and Polokwane to effect an endorsement against the registration of the properties to reflect this order. According to the SIU, the matter relates to a water project that was meant to benefit about 50 villages in Giyani, Limpopo Province. The Department of Water and Sanitation appointed Lepelle Northern Water to oversee the project. “The SIU investigation has uncovered information which suggest that Lepelle Northern Water awarded a contract to a third party to work on the project irregularly while Mr. Legodi was in charge. He has since resigned from his position as CEO of the Lepelle Northern Water”, the SIU said in a statement. “The SIU is an independent forensic and litigation agency tasked with the role of investigating serious malpractice, malfeasance and maladministration in relation to the administration of State institutions, State assets and public money as well as any conduct which may seriously harm the interest of the State and the public”, concluded the SIU in their statement.
