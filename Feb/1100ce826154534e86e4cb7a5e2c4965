By: Sello Theletsane Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is expted to arrive in Nkandla at 12 noon where he is set to meet with former President Jacob Zuma in a bid to convince him to return to the state capture commission. Zuma announced earlier this week through a statement that he would not be attending the commission’s proceedings. This after a Constitutional Court ordered him to do so. In his statement, Zuma also accused the courts of behaving like the apartheid government. Following Zuma’s announcement, Malema took to Twitter, asking to hold discussions with Zuma over tea, a request which Zuma agreed to. Malema also roped in his friend, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina. The two are expected to meet with Zuma this afternoon. Another Zuma ally, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule defended the former president, calling for him to be left alone.
